#This command must be done with admin perms since it contacts the Windows32 directory. If you are having issues running it as a script or through ISE run it with the following structure as a single Command.

#In order to make use of this information you need to find the oem##.inf file. Procedure to follow.

#Go to "Device Manager"
#Go to the desired device
#Right Click and Select "Properties"
#Go to the "Details" Tab
#Under the "Property" there is a drop down box.
#Select the "Property" drop down box.
#Find and select "Inf name".
#Under "Value" you should see some kind of name that resembles "oem##.inf" where ## is a number.
#This is your oem#.inf file.

#Scan the output of the above script for a corresponding "oem##.inf" file.
#Once you've found the correct record look at the "OriginalFileName".
#Example

#Driver           : oem99.inf
#OriginalFileName : C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\Example.inf_amd64_asf0sr00vfcfg\Example.inf
#Inbox            : False
#ClassName        : NetService
#BootCritical     : False
#ProviderName     : Example Dev LLC
#Date             : xx/xx/xxxx 12:00:00 AM
#Version          : x.x.x.x.x

#In your export file you should attempt to find a folder matching the filepath after "FileRepository". In the above example we are looking for "Example.inf_amd64_asf0sr00vfcfg\Example.inf"
#That file should be your Driver.
#From here you can move that file to your desired device and install it as you would any other 3rd party Windows Driver
