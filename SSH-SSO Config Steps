For instnace you will do "First part of the key" <cr> "Second part of the key" <cr> "Third part of the key" <cr> until you have entered the whole key.

@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
51:82:00:1c:7e:6f:ac:ac:de:f1:53:08:1c:7d:55:68.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /Users/isaacalves/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending RSA key in /Users/isaacalves/.ssh/known_hosts:12
RSA host key for 104.131.16.158 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.

#Then open .ssh/known_hosts and delete the key addressed in the message. In the above example it is the 12th line.
#Reattempt the SSH and you should be asked to verify the RSA key fingerprint again.
